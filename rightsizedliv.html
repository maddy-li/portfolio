      <h2>Reflection</h2>
      <p>This was my first major project in UX/UI, and I am happy to say that I'm extremely proud of it! <br>Some major takeaways include:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>"communication is not only essential, it's valuable!" It really emphasized the importance of consistant communication and effort, especially when it comes to learning of the design the client envisioned, and creating it!</li>
        <li>"consistency is key" / client comes first? </li>
      </ul>
