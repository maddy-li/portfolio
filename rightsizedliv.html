          <h2 class="project-header-2">Description</h2>
          <p class="project-para">Designed and developed a prototype website in collaboration with a small, local business. My role was the UX/UI designer in charge of design and remained in close contact with the business owner to offer suggestions and ensure the product reflected the vision of her company. The website was designed and prototyped using Figma and created using HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap in collaboration with a fellow team-member.  </p>
            <h2 class="project-header-2">Overview</h2>
            <p class="project-para">RightSized Living is a start-up company that provides personalized and compassionate support for elderly individuals moving into senior living. Unlike other moving services, they value the individual's emotional well-being during this challenging transition. Each move is specialized to simplify the process and address unique needs, ensuring a seamless and stress-free experience.</p>
<h2 class="project-header-2">Objective</h2>
            <p class="project-para">Develop and design a website that effectively communicates the core values of the company, appeals to the target audience, and provides a seamless user experience that is accessible and user-friendly to all ages.</p>
            <h2 class="project-header-2">Problems</h2>
            <ul>
              <li>1.<br><b>Appealing to Target Audience</b><br>While the company's services are catered to the elderly, the target audience also includes the children and grandchildren will also be looking for these services in their stead. Therefore, there is a need for the website to cater to both the elderly and those who could be looking for them. </li>
              <li>2.<br><b>Ensuring Accessibility</b><br>Because the service is for the elderly, it is important for the website to be easy to navigate and simple to understand by those who may not be as familiar to the internet.</li>
              <li>3.<br><b>Emphasizing the Customer</b><br>One request from the owner was to make sure anyone who found the website to know that the company's mission is more than simply doing services, but truly catering and personalizing their work for "YOU!".</li>
          </ul>
            <h2 class="project-header-2">Solutions</h2>
            <ul>
              <li>1.<br><b>Target Audience Representation</b><br>Visuals were chosen to represent a diverse age group, including elderly individuals and families with children and grandchildren. This approach helps create a welcoming and inclusive atmosphere on the website, showcasing seniors enjoying the company's services alongside interactions with younger family members.</li>
              <li>2.<br><b>Simplified Visual Interface</b><br>To ensure accessibility, the website's visual interface is designed with simplicity in mind. Large, easy-to-read fonts, high-contrast colors, and a clean layout are implemented. Navigation menus are straightforward, and icons are intuitive, making it user-friendly even for those who may not be familiar with the internet. Additionally, clear and concise headings and labels are used to guide users effectively.</li>
              <li>3.<br><b>Incorporating Testimonials</b><br>To establish trust and credibility, the website includes a "Testimonials" page where clients, both elderly and their family members, can share their positive experiences with the company's services.  They are presented in a user-friendly format, with quotes from satisfied customers accompanied by their names and photos, if available, to reassure potential clients of the quality and reliability of the services. </li>
          </ul>
            <h2 class="project-header-2">Outcome</h2>
            <p class="project-para">Through the implementation of the proposed solutions and careful consideration throughout the design process, the Rightsized Living website successfully communicates with its targeted user audience through user-friendly design choices!</p>
            <p class="project-para">Some major takeaways and reflections include:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>1.<br><b>Communication is Essential</b><br>Our consistent communication and effort towards collaborating with the client allowed us to approach the project effectively, particularly when understanding the client's envisioned design and bringing it to life."</li>
              <li>2.<br><b>The Client Comes First</b><br>In the world of design, the paramount principle is aligning every design choice with the client's needs. This approach ensures that every decision made is centered around fulfilling their unique vision, resulting in a compelling and unified brand identity.</li>
